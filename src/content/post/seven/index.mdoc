Please picture me\
In the trees\
I hit my peak at seven feet\
In the swing\
Over the creek\
I was too scared to jump in\
But I, I was high in the sky\
With Pennsylvania under me\
Are there still beautiful things?

Sweet tea in the summer\
Cross your heart, won't tell no other\
And though I can't recall your face\
I still got love for you\
Your braids like a pattern\
Love you to the moon and to Saturn\
Passed down like folk songs\
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you\
I think your house is haunted\
Your dad is always mad and that must be why\
And I think you should come live with\
Me and we can be pirates\
Then you won't have to cry\
Or hide in the closet\
And just like a folk song\
Our love will be passed on

Please picture me\
In the weeds\
Before I learned civility\
I used to scream ferociously\
Any time I wanted\
I, I

Sweet tea in the summer\
Cross my heart, won't tell no other\
And though I can't recall your face\
I still got love for you\
Pack your dolls and a sweater\
We'll move to India forever\
Passed down like folk songs\
Our love lasts so long
