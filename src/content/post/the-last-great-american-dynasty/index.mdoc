Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny\
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis\
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money\
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorc√©e do it?"\
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche\
There's only so far new money goes\
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"\
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud\
The doctor had told him to settle down\
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said\
"There goes the last great American dynasty\
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been\
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen\
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever\
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city\
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names\
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet\
And losing on card game bets with Dali

And they said\
"There goes the last great American dynasty\
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been\
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen\
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

They say she was seen on occasion\
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea\
And in a feud with her neighbor\
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green\
50 years is a long time\
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach\
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits\
And then it was bought by me

Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been\
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen\
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

I had a marvelous time ruining everything\
A marvelous time ruining everything\
A marvelous time\
I had a marvelous time
